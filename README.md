# DelhiMetroAnalysis

Overview
This project provides a Python-based analysis of the Delhi Metro network, treating it as a complex graph. Using libraries like pandas for data handling and networkx for graph theory, it aims to extract insights into the metro's structure, connectivity, and efficiency.

Key aspects explored include:

Network Modeling: Representing stations as nodes and connections as edges.
Connectivity & Pathfinding: Analyzing how stations are interconnected and finding shortest routes.
Station Importance: Identifying central or highly influential stations within the network using various metrics.
Data Visualization: Creating graphical representations of the metro map and analytical findings.
This project builds upon and enhances an initial analysis shared by Aman XAI. My contributions focus on [briefly mention 1-2 key changes, e.g., "adding new centrality metrics," "improving visualizations," or "refactoring for clarity"].
